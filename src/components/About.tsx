        airWrks is a music production workshop that integrates technology and
        creativity to help the youth develop their music production skills.
        Through the use of FL Studio, participants learn how to record, edit,
        mix, and master audio, and gain insight into the similarities between
        coding and music production. By exploring the interplay between
        technology and creativity, airWrks empowers individuals to create music
        that is both technically sophisticated and artistically expressive.
